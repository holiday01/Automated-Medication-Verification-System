# Automated-Medication-Verification-System (AMVS)

This system is developed on a Raspberry Pi device, using a CNN model to predict drug types. To achieve easy model training, users only need to take photos, and the model training is completed with just one click. Model inference can analyze multiple drugs in the same image, achieving segmentation using a classification approach.
